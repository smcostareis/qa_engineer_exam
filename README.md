Before run the tests you shoul run either:
run the back end
run the front end

Run the test:

npm install
npm cypress open

The cypress Dashboard will open and you can choose the test you want to run.


# Final notes:

There is much to improve such as run the backend and front end automatically.
The tests are simple examples so there was so many automated scenarios I could write.
I could have also implemented the test scenarios with gherkin.

There are some bugs like:
- United Brands request is not working
